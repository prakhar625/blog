<h3>1. The Lean Startup</h3>
<p><em>by Eric Ries</em></p><p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQFwZySR8GhBjw/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1520141216977?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=_roZTDbMFp4v1Dq4iwDyzS3C9Ax8JOXfWzracCWuzlo" alt="Book Image"></p><h5>Abstract:</h5>
<p>Most startups fail. But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched.</p><p>Eric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.</p><p>The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on &quot;validated learning,&quot; rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.</p><p>Rather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it's too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/10127019">Goodreads</a></p><h3>2. Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love</h3>
<p><em>by Marty Cagan</em></p><p><img src="https://www.theproducthub.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/431345e16982fecd1307dda1d8ebea54.jpg" alt="Cover Image"></p><h6>Abstract:</h6>
<p>The basic premise of Inspired is that the best tech companies create products in a manner very different from how most companies create products. The goal of the book is to share the techniques of the best companies. This book is aimed primarily at Product Managers working on technology-powered products. That includes the hundreds of &quot;tech companies&quot; like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the like, as well as the thousands of companies moving to leverage technology (financial companies, media companies, retailers, manufacturers, nearly every industry). Inspired covers companies from early stage start-ups to large, established companies. The products might be consumer products or devices, business services for small businesses to enterprises, internal tools, and developer platforms.</p><p>Inspired is secondarily aimed at the designers, engineers, user researchers and data scientists that work closely with the product managers on product teams at these same companies.</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35249663">Goodreads</a></p><h3>3. Empowered: Ordinary People, Extraordinary Products</h3>
<p><em>by Marty Cagan</em></p><p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5fad9cd8048f2f6bde076960/1616865484419-0YBRHAPKC26RV3P7WV7B/Image+from+iOS+(1).jpg" alt="Cover Image"></p><h6>Abstract:</h6>
<p>What is it about the top tech product companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix and Tesla that enables their record of consistent innovation?   Most people think it’s because these companies are somehow able to find and attract a level of talent that makes this innovation possible. But the real advantage these companies have is not so much who they hire, but rather how they enable their people to work together to solve hard problems and create extraordinary products.  As legendary Silicon Valley coach--and coach to the founders of several of today’s leading tech companies--Bill Campbell said, “Leadership is about recognizing that there's a greatness in everyone, and your job is to create an environment where that greatness can emerge.”  The goal of EMPOWERED is to provide you, as a leader of product management, product design, or engineering, with everything you’ll need to create just such an environment.  As partners at The Silicon Valley Product Group, Marty Cagan and Chris Jones have long worked to reveal the best practices of the most consistently innovative companies in the world. A natural companion to the bestseller INSPIRED, EMPOWERED tackles head-on the reason why most companies fail to truly leverage the potential of their people to innovate: product leadership.  The book covers: EMPOWERED puts decades of lessons learned from the best leaders of the top technology companies in your hand as a guide. It shows you how to become the leader your team and company needs to not only survive but thrive.</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53481975">Goodreads</a></p><h3>4. Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon</h3>
<p><em>by Bill Carr and Colin Bryar</em></p><p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dYbZIG5rBag/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Cover Image"></p><h6>Abstract:</h6>
<p>Working Backwards is an insider's breakdown of Amazon's approach to culture, leadership, and best practices from two long-time, top-level Amazon executives.</p><p>Colin started at Amazon in 1998; Bill joined in 1999. In Working Backwards, these two long-serving Amazon executives reveal and codify the principles and practices that drive the success of one of the most extraordinary companies the world has ever known. With twenty-seven years of Amazon experience between them, much of it in the early aughts—a period of unmatched innovation that brought products and services including Kindle, Amazon Prime, Amazon Studios, and Amazon Web Services to life—Bryar and Carr offer unprecedented access to the Amazon way as it was refined, articulated, and proven to be repeatable, scalable, and adaptable.</p><p>With keen analysis and practical steps for applying it at your own company—no matter the size—the authors illuminate how Amazon’s fourteen leadership principles inform decision-making at all levels and reveal how the company’s culture has been defined by four characteristics: customer obsession, long-term thinking, eagerness to invent, and operational excellence. Bryar and Carr explain the set of ground-level practices that ensure these are translated into action and flow through all aspects of the business.</p><p>Working Backwards is a practical guidebook and a corporate narrative, filled with the authors’ in-the-room recollections of what “Being Amazonian” is like and how it has affected their personal and professional lives. They demonstrate that success on Amazon’s scale is not achieved by the genius of any single leader, but rather through commitment to and execution of a set of well-defined, rigorously-executed principles and practices—shared here for the very first time.</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53138083">Goodreads</a></p><h3>5. Measure What Matters</h3>
<p><em>by John Doerr</em></p><p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQE-brUxbqmCug/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1606340853336?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=hVB7K9J2AATVY9XxiL-OPR65MaYYFw4WeZxBw-oqAyI" alt="Cover Image"></p><h6>Abstract:</h6>
<p>The revolutionary movement behind the explosive growth of Intel, Google, Amazon and Uber.
With a foreword by Larry Page, and contributions from Bono and Bill Gates.</p><p>Measure What Matters is about using Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), a revolutionary approach to goal-setting, to make tough choices in business.</p><p>In 1999, legendary venture capitalist John Doerr invested nearly $12 million in a startup that had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. Doerr introduced the founders to OKRs and with them at the foundation of their management, the startup grew from forty employees to more than 70,000 with a market cap exceeding $600 billion. The startup was Google.</p><p>Since then Doerr has introduced OKRs to more than fifty companies, helping tech giants and charities exceed all expectations. In the OKR model objectives define what we seek to achieve and key results are how those top­ priority goals will be attained. OKRs focus effort, foster coordination and enhance workplace satisfaction. They surface an organization's most important work as everyone's goals from entry-level to CEO are transparent to the entire institution.</p><p>In Measure What Matters, Doerr shares a broad range of first-person, behind-the-scenes case studies, with narrators including Bono and Bill Gates, to demonstrate the focus, agility, and explosive growth that OKRs have spurred at so many great organizations.</p><p>This book will show you how to collect timely, relevant data to track progress - to measure what matters. It will help any organization or team aim high, move fast, and excel.</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39286958">Goodreads</a></p><h3>6. The Hard Thing About Hard Things</h3>
<p><em>by Ben Horowitz</em></p><p><img src="https://www.karthikchidambaram.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/blog-image.png" alt="Cover Image"></p><h6>Abstract:</h6>
<p>A lot of people talk about how great it is to start a business, but only Ben Horowitz is brutally honest about how hard it is to run one.</p><p>In The Hard Thing About Hard Things, Ben Horowitz, cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz and one of Silicon Valley's most respected and experienced entrepreneurs, draws on his own story of founding, running, selling, buying, managing, and investing in technology companies to offer essential advice and practical wisdom for navigating the toughest problems business schools don't cover. His blog has garnered a devoted following of millions of readers who have come to rely on him to help them run their businesses. A lifelong rap fan, Horowitz amplifies business lessons with lyrics from his favorite songs and tells it straight about everything from firing friends to poaching competitors, from cultivating and sustaining a CEO mentality to knowing the right time to cash in.</p><p>His advice is grounded in anecdotes from his own hard-earned rise—from cofounding the early cloud service provider Loudcloud to building the phenomenally successful Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, both with fellow tech superstar Marc Andreessen (inventor of Mosaic, the Internet's first popular Web browser). This is no polished victory lap; he analyzes issues with no easy answers through his trials, including demoting (or firing) a loyal friend;
whether you should incorporate titles and promotions, and how to handle them;
if it's OK to hire people from your friend's company; how to manage your own psychology, while the whole company is relying on you; what to do when smart people are bad employees; why Andreessen Horowitz prefers founder CEOs, and how to become one; whether you should sell your company, and how to do it.</p><p>Filled with Horowitz's trademark humor and straight talk, and drawing from his personal and often humbling experiences, The Hard Thing About Hard Things is invaluable for veteran entrepreneurs as well as those aspiring to their own new ventures.</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things">Goodreads</a></p><h3>7. The Mom Test: How to talk to customers &amp; learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is lying to you</h3>
<p><em>by Rob Fitzpatrick</em></p><p><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/D5627AQGJ1Xiepgdfng/articleshare-shrink_800/0/1704211710710?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=vdxxZAFflU2DvWGxPiq-erN8u9JfZFAbVwOTZ6miZ3o" alt="Cover Image"></p><h6>Abstract:</h6>
<p>The Mom Test is a quick, practical guide that will save you time, money, and heartbreak.</p><p>They say you shouldn't ask your mom whether your business is a good idea, because she loves you and will lie to you. This is technically true, but it misses the point. You shouldn't ask anyone if your business is a good idea. It's a bad question and everyone will lie to you at least a little . As a matter of fact, it's not their responsibility to tell you the truth. It's your responsibility to find it and it's worth doing right .</p><p>Talking to customers is one of the foundational skills of both Customer Development and Lean Startup. We all know we're supposed to do it, but nobody seems willing to admit that it's easy to screw up and hard to do right. This book is going to show you how customer conversations go wrong and how you can do better.</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/52283963">Goodreads</a></p><h3>8.

<p>Authored by 3 Product Managers at Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, Product Management’s Sacred Seven is a comprehensive resource that will teach you the must-know knowledge and applied skills necessary to become a world-class PM that can get hired anywhere.</p><p>In writing this book, we interviewed 67 product leads and hiring managers from 52 top companies around the world. They ranged from all the usual FAANG suspects to darling unicorns such as Coinbase, TikTok, and Grab. We asked everyone two simple questions:</p><ol>
<li><p>What knowledge separates interview candidates you hire from those you don't?</p></li>
<li><p>What hard skills help PMs advance their careers the fastest?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Given that we talked to product leaders across the world who worked in various different countries and industries, we expected to see no clear pattern in our responses. We were shocked to find a common theme across all of our interviews. The knowledge and skills which separated exceptional PMs from the rest all boiled down to seven subjects: product design, economics, psychology, user experience, data science, law &amp; policy, and marketing &amp; growth.</p><p>The average PM excels at 2 or 3 of these disciplines. A truly world-class product manager, however, thrives in all 7.

<p>The new era of Gamification and Human-Focused Design optimizes for motivation and engagement over traditional Function-Focused Design. Within the industry, studies on game mechanics and behavioral psychology have become proliferate. However, few people understand how to merge the two fields into experience designs that reliably increases business metrics and generates a return on investment. Gamification Pioneer Yu-kai Chou takes reader on a journey to learn his twelve years of obsessive research in creating the Octalysis Framework, and how to apply the framework to create engaging and successful experiences in their product, workplace, marketing, and personal lives. Effective gamification is a combination of game design, game dynamics, behavioral economics, motivational psychology, UX/UI (User Experience and User Interface), neurobiology, technology platforms, as well as ROI-driving business implementations. This book explores the interplay between these disciplines to capture the core principles that contribute to good gamification design. The goal for this book is to become a strategy guide to help readers master the games that truly make a difference in their lives. Readers who absorb the contents of this book will have literally obtained what many companies pay tens of thousands of dollars to acquire. The ultimate aim is to enable the widespread adoption of good gamification and human-focused design in all types of industries.</p><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25416321-actionable-gamification">Goodreads</a></p><h3>16.

<p>How do successful companies create products people can’t put down?</p><p>Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop? What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?
Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.</p><p>Hooked is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products. Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior.</p><p>Eyal provides readers with:</p><ul>
<li><p>Practical insights to create user habits that stick.</p></li>
<li><p>Actionable steps for building products people love.</p></li>
<li><p>Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.</p></li>
